            It is used by large, established companies and newly-minted startups alike
            (Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram, and the New York Times, to name a few). React 
            brings many advantages to the table, making it a better choice than other 
            frameworks like Angular.js..`,

            for web and mobile applications. It is an open-source, component-based, front-end library 
            responsible only for the applicationâ€™s view layer. In Model View Controller (MVC) architecture, 
            the view layer is responsible for how the app looks and feels. React was created by Jordan Walke,
             a software engineer at Facebook. `

            Until Node.js came along, there was really no way to run JavaScript outside of
             a browser. When we write a backend server and database, Node.js is a popular 
             choice because we can run our code as a standalone application rather than 
             something that can only be evaluated in a browser environment.`
